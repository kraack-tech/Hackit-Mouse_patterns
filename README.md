# Hack it: Mouse patterns
## Associated with CM2030 Graphics Programming module

### Objective:
####  In this example, we're replacing the ball which is chasing the mouse and instead we're tracing a line under an imaginary ball. You'll need to draw a line between the location of the ball object (aka location) as well and its location in the previous frame (aka prevLocation). Start from the example code.
